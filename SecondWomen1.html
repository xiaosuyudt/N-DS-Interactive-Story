<h2>I went one day alone to a cafe on the Ginza. 
    <br>
    <br>
    I had only ten yen on me. 
    <br>
    <br>
    I said with a smile to the hostess who sat beside me.
    <br> 
    <br>
    “All I’ve got is ten yen. Consider yourself warned.”
    <br>
    <br>
    “You needn’t worry.”
    <br>
    <br>
    She spoke with a trace of a Kansai accent.
    <br>
    <br>
    It was strange how she calmed my agitation with those few words. </h2>
